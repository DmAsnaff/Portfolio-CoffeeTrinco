Hello, Im Mohamed Asnaff
I have  Created a portfolio website for one of my Dream, A Coffee Shop named Trico Coffee. 
It briefly explains about the shop and products that are available in that shop. 
Also it tells about the future moves of the startup. It has toggle button option, contact form option with the validations.
Also it has image slider option which showcase the memories of the shop.




>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  I have Choosen Includeing Database Configuration in GitHub Repository <<<<<<<<<<<<<<

My Database Credintials : 

$host = 'localhost';
$username = 'root';
$password = '';
$database = 'coffee_db';

step 01 -> clone the whole file to xampp server's htdocs folder.
step 02 -> There will be a database sql file named coffee_db.sql. You have to import that file into database on phpmyadmin. 
step 03 ->  open the index.html file in localhost to experience the php functions.
