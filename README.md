Hello, Im Mohamed Asnaff
I have  Created a portfolio website for one of my Dream, A Coffee Shop named Trico Coffee. 
It briefly explains about the shop and products that are available in that shop. 
Also it tells about the future moves of the startup. It has toggle button option, contact form option with the validations.
Also it has image slider option which showcase the memories of the shop.
